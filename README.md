# SputnikRedeSensores

Open source project of a sensors test suit.

The goal is to develop a system to compare several sensors of each type out of several types.
The sensors will be assembled on a PCB for each type, that will connect to an Arduino Due compatible shield.
A program running on the Arduino, will log sensors data to a SD card and make it accessible through a FTP server.

types of sensors:
Temperature and relative humidity;
Superficial temperature;
Motion detection;
Air quality;
Electrical current;
Water flow;
Proximity;
Distance;
Microwave;
Lumen;
UV.
